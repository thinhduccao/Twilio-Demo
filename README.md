# A quick and dirty C# console app for testing Twilio
Usage: 
1. Create your own Twilio account https://www.twilio.com/
2. Create a .txt file with your Twilio's account credential in the following format:
  [Sid] \n  [AuthToken] \n  [Twilio phone number] \n
3. From Visual Studio, run the application, and follow the console's instructions

<strong>Note</strong>: Storing Twilio account's credentials in a text file is NOT secure and should NOT be used in a production application.
